# Google Play Store Upload Guide for Call to islam App

## üîê Step 1: Update Keystore Configuration

You need to update the `/Users/ibrahim/Documents/contributions/call_to_islam/android/key.properties` file with the actual passwords you used when creating the keystore.

**IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholder values in `android/key.properties`:

```
storePassword=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../../../upload-keystore.jks
```

Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_PASSWORD` with the passwords you entered when the keystore was created.

## üì± Step 2: Build the App Bundle

After updating the passwords, run:

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
